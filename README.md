These to little program can comunicate using unix user signals to transmit information bit by bit, server then print on the console 1 or 0 depending of the signal received.

*I put this here for educational purposes only do NOT use it for production*

Please note that this is a very uneffective way to transmit data between to processes, the best way to do that is to use a file, or the network preferentially with unix socket under unix systems.
